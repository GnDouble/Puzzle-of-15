# Java Puzzle Game

## Overview

This project is a small GUI-based puzzle game developed in Java using Swing. The game involves a grid of numbered buttons where players must rearrange the numbers into the correct order by sliding them into an empty space. This project serves as an educational tool for learning about Java GUI programming, object-oriented design, and event handling.

## Goals

- **Learn Java Swing**: Gain experience with creating graphical user interfaces in Java using the Swing library.
- **Understand MVC Pattern**: Implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate game logic, user interface, and user interaction.
- **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**: Create an interactive game that requires logic and problem-solving to complete.
- **Implement Event Handling**: Use action listeners to handle user input and update the GUI accordingly.

## Features

- A 4x4 grid of buttons representing the puzzle.
- Ability to restart the game.
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect button placements.
