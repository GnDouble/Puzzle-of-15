In this repository, you'll find the implementation of the beloved 15-Puzzle Game, created during my second-semester programming course. This sliding puzzle features a 4x4 grid of numbered square tiles, shuffled randomly with one tile intentionally left vacant. The ultimate aim? To arrange the tiles in numerical order by skillfully sliding them around, taking advantage of the vacant space. The entire implementation is crafted using Java, with a primary focus on mastering the intricacies of the javax.swing package for graphical user interface development.
